# 🚨 Accident Detection and Alert System

This project is a real-time accident detection and alert system using GPS, GSM, accelerometer, and gyroscope modules. The aim is to improve emergency response by automatically detecting accidents and immediately notifying emergency contacts with location details.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Accident Detection** based on sudden changes in acceleration and orientation.
- 📡 **Real-Time GPS Tracking** to fetch exact latitude and longitude of the incident.
- 📲 **GSM-Based Alert System** to send SMS alerts to emergency contacts instantly.
- 📈 **Threshold Calibration** to reduce false positives from potholes or harsh braking.
- 🔋 **Low Power Consumption** for long-term use in vehicles or wearables.
- 🔧 **Modular Design** suitable for bikes, cars, and personal safety gear.

## 🔌 Working Principle

1. **Data Collection**: The accelerometer and gyroscope constantly monitor movement and orientation.
2. **Threshold Check**: If a sudden spike in acceleration is detected (suggesting a crash), the system checks if it surpasses the pre-set threshold.
3. **Location Fetching**: If confirmed, the GPS module retrieves current location coordinates.
4. **Alert Triggering**: The GSM module sends an SMS with a Google Maps link of the location to predefined emergency contacts.
5. **Optional Alert**: Local buzzer/LED can be triggered for nearby assistance.
